Kaggle Completition Assignment, Predictive Analytics

This is Bob Stine's submission for the Predictive Analytics assignment to complete
a problem from the Kaggle competition.

PART 1: PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

I chose the "Prudential Life Insurance Assessment" problem, described here:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/prudential-life-insurance-assessment/data

This problem is to develop an automated method to evaluate risk of granting 
life insurance to applicants, given values such as age, weight, health history,
and employment history.  Risk is an ordinal measure of 8 levels.

PART 2: INITIAL ANALYSIS APPROACH

The first step is to analyze the data.  Some fields are integral, others are
categorical. The initial steps will be:

1. review the fields and their values.
2. select fields to use in model.
3. "chunk" integral fields into categories, based on their ranges. 

After selecting and preparing the fields to use as input, use R to:

1. Partition the data into a training set and a test set.
2. Train a decision tree to predict accelerated claim approval,
   using the training set.
3. Observe results when the tree is applied to the test set.
