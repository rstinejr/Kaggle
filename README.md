# Kaggle
Kaggle competition, BNP Paribas Cardiff Claims Management

This project is my response to an assignment in
[*Practical Predictive Analytics*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/predictive-analytics), offered by Coursera.

The assignment was to complete a competition problem posed by Kaggle, "the home of Data Science".
See https://www.kaggle.com/.

The problem I chose to tackle was in predictino whether insurance claims were appropriate for expedited service, as
opposed to requiring more information.
