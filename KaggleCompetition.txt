Kaggle Completition Assignment, Predictive Analytics

This is Bob Stine's submission for the Predictive Analytics assignment to complete
a problem from the Kaggle competition.

PART 1: PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

I chose the "BNP Paribas Cardif Claims Management" problem, described here:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/bnp-paribas-cardif-claims-management/

This problem is to develop an automated method to sort submitted insurance
claims into two categories:
    1. claims for which approval could be accelerated
    2. claims that require addional information before they can be approved.

The anonymized claim data contains 134 categorical and numberic variables.  The result
is 1 for suitable for accelerated approval, 0 for claims requiring more information.

The task is to predict the probability that a claims adjuster would approve a particular claim.

PART 2: INITIAL ANALYSIS APPROACH

The first step is to analyze the data.  Some fields are integral, others are
categorical. The initial steps will be:

1. review the fields and their values.
2. select fields to use in model.
3. "chunk" integral fields into categories, based on their ranges. 

After selecting and preparing the fields to use as input, use R to:

1. Partition the data into a training set and a test set.
2. Train a decision tree to predict accelerated claim approval,
   using the training set.
3. Observe results when the tree is applied to the test set.
